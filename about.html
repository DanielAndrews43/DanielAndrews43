      Hi, I'm Daniel! I am currently a junior studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) 
      at UC Berkeley. I am taking the semester off to work on some cool projects I've had in store for a while,
      to travel because a bunch of my friends are going abroad, and to work on some projects that I 
      have already made.
      <br />
      <br />
      Some cool things that I have worked on in the past can be found under my projects list, but I highly 
      reccomend checking out my <a href="https://www.hellobook.io">coffe table book</a> or my "startup" 
      <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yearbook-photo-a-day/id1229001571?mt=8">YearBook</a>. I have put
      a bunch of time into these projects.
